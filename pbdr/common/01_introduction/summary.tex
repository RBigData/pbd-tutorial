    \begin{itemize}
%    \item R is the high-level ``language'' for data science
    \item Three flavors of hardware
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Distributed is stable
      \item Multicore and co-processor are evolving
      \item Two memory models
      \item Distributed works in multicore, but not the other way around
      \end{itemize}
    \item Medium to big machines have all three
    \item HPC Libraries can span hierarchy
    \item A confusing diversity of parallel R packages exists
    \item \pbdR currently batch, eventually client-server
    \end{itemize}
