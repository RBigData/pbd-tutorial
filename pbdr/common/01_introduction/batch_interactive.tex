    \item Data reduction to knowledge
    \item Iterative process with same data
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Exploration, model construction
      \item Diagnostics of fit and quantification of uncertainty
      \item Interpretation
      \end{itemize}
    \item S (and R) interactive ``answer'' to batch data analysis
    \item Efficient use of expensive people

    \item Traditionally data generation by simulation science
    \item Data processed mostly by visualization
    \item Efficient use of expensive platforms

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Parallel visualization systems (VisIt and ParaView) are
      client-server (batch on server)
    \item Current \pbdR packages address server side (batch)
    \item \pbdR client under development
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Bridge laptop to login node to resource manager to cluster
      \item Site configuration file
      \item Manage relationship of big data (server side) to little
        data (client side)
      \end{itemize}
    %\item Need intuitive parallel data input
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item High-level functional language: a function is a ``batch'' script
    \item \R ``An interactive environment to use batch scripts''
