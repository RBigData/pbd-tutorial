      Server} 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Parallel visualization systems (VisIt and ParaView) are
      client-server (batch on server)
    \item Current \pbdR packages address server side (batch)
    \item \pbdR client under development
      \begin{itemize}
      \item SPMD interactive (pbdCS, alpha on GitHub)
      \item Bridge laptop to login node to resource manager to cluster
      \item Site configuration file
      \item Manage relationship of big data (server side) to little
        data (client side)
